    <!-- Master's Capstone Project -->
    <h3>Master’s Capstone Project</h3>
    <strong>Biostatistics Capstone Master’s Project: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Combined Pharmacist and Primary Care Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Management</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborated with Valley View Health Center to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist- and physician-led interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes using a retrospective cohort study.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a statistical analysis plan (SAP) incorporating generalized estimating equations (GEE), linear regression models, and Cox proportional hazards regression to assess longitudinal changes in A1C, blood pressure, and weight.</li>
        <li>Identified that pharmacist-led interventions were more effective for patients with baseline A1C &lt;8%, while primary care alone achieved faster A1C reduction in patients with baseline A1C ≥8%. Time-to-event analysis revealed slower A1C normalization in the pharmacist-led group compared to primary care alone.</li>
        <li>Developed data visualizations, including spaghetti plots, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, regression model outputs, and summary tables, to effectively communicate key results.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Class Project -->
    <h3>Class Project</h3>
<strong><a href="MARS.pdf">A Case Study: Understanding Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)</a></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Explored the theoretical foundation and key principles of MARS.</li>
        <li>Implemented MARS using the earth package in R and applied it to a real-world dataset for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
	 <strong>A Study of Integrated Primary Care in Assertive Community Treatment Services (ACT) </strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Authored protocol for a phase 3 multi-center randomized controlled trial (n=444) to evaluate integrated primary care impact on health outcomes for adults with serious mental illness (SMI).</li>
        <li>Developed comprehensive statistical analysis plans for randomized controlled trials, including randomization strategies, sample size calculations, and primary outcome analyses using the SF-36 health survey, ensuring methodological rigor and adherence to research standards.</li>
    </ul>
	
    <!-- Independent Project -->
    <h3>Independent Project</h3>
    <strong>Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Selection Bias Adjustment in ACT Study</strong><br>
<ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented three machine learning models (Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict participant selection for autopsy, evaluating model performance using metrics like calibration, AUC, and Brier score.</li>
        <li>Conducted simulation studies and applied inverse probability weighting (IPW) techniques to address selection bias in the association analysis between neuropathology measures and Dementia, Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
        <li>Analyzed the impact of model discrimination and calibration on estimating associations, providing insights into the effectiveness of bias adjustment methods.</li>
    </ul>
<!-- Kaggle Competition -->
    <h3>Kaggle Competition</h3>
    <strong>WiDS Datathon: ADHD Diagnosis Prediction </strong><br>
    <strong>Team Leader</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed an ensemble model (XGBoost + Logistic Regression in Python) integrating fMRI connectome matrices with socio-demographic data, achieving 0.82 AUC in cross-validation.</li>
        <li>Implemented Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) in Python to address selection bias and class imbalance, improving model sensitivity by 15% for female ADHD detection.</li>
        <li>Engineered a feature extraction pipeline for fMRI data using graph theory metrics (e.g., node degree, clustering coefficient), reducing dimensionality from 10k+ to 300 critical features.</li>
    </ul>
